Intruiging noodles, triangles of rice paper, basically.
Big powder packet for soup base, and pepper packet (as advertised excitedly on package).
Pepper is indeed white pepper despite the package depicting green peppercorns.
Side note: I'm not sure how you're supposed to stop these from sticking together... Flat sheets...

Very sweet, five spice broth.
I suspect the 600ml water recommendations would have made it extremely diluted.

Noodles very slippery but good bite.
Broth very average.
Noodles refuse to absorb broth nor hold it.
