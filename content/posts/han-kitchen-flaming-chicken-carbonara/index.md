The spicy sauce still has some heat and bitterness.
I think the didn't adjust the spice packet and just hoped to cut it with the cheese.
For making broth, it was bad.
I bet the flavor combo would demolish an egg yolk, fried egg, or veggies.
It tastes little like carbonara but the powder packet did sport some herbs.
The heat was tolerable but still pretty hot.

The noodles bubbled up quite a bit.
They were pretty good, not amazing, but above average.
They were quite fat and chewy, even with full cooking.

Overall the above average heat and different noodles is nice but not something I would seek out.
