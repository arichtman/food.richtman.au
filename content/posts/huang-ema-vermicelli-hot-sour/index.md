I picked this once cause it smelled strong from outside the packet

Looots of ingredients.
Veg flake, black vinegar, hot oil, bean shoots, chilli-pickle bamboo shoot, bean paste, roast chickpeas...

Delish!
Quite strong flavor and complex!
Makes soup!

Pickled bamboo is delightful, chickpeas keep crunch.
