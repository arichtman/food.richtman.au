Wow ingredients, big meat pouch AND meat sauce pouch, doubled up fried bean curd skin, variety veggies...
GHOST pepper powder?!
Totally uncooked dried noodles.
Love the packs mostly have English on them.

Fried diced meat pretty sure is seitan or something.
Braised meat sauce is broad be any and savory.
Pork bone wet soup concentrate is very good, looks awful but tangy and rich.
Bean sprouts really well seasoned.
Other veg okay, like one token corn piece though.

Somehow I just don't _love_ the flavor.
It's rich and a little tangy but just misses the classic Chinese flavor profile.
