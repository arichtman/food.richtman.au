Ripply wheat noodles, thick, marmitey and sweet aged vinegar, and a really flavorful chilli oil with seasoned minced pork?
Loads of roasted green chilli's in oil.
Given the oil and vinegar I'm going to attempt emulsion.

Noodles claim sundried and hand made.
I cooked my noodles longer as I like then properly cooked anyway.
I didn't manage much of an  emulsion.

God damn these are good.
Savory, light from the green chilli with roasted pepper, amazing noodle feel.
