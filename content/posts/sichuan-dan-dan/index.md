Noodles are wheat noodles but fat and wide.
Noodles like this are uncommon.
I steeped as per instructions but wasn't happy with how cooked the noodles were.
After the 6 minute steep I microwaved for ~1 minute.
The noodles boiled over quite strongly, glad I was watching.

The taste is quite nice, it almost tastes like there's pork added.
It's a little salty and chemically but not overwhelmingly so.
Medium numbing quality, this could support a few vegetables added.
The wet pouch of pickled beans was nice and snappy.
It was a little too salty when prepared dry.
Overall it was pleasant but I wouldn't pick it out specifically from a crowd.
