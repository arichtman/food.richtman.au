Just a sauce packet and some greasy-looking noodles.
Watch out as the noodles bubble up a lot during cooking.

The miso paste seems to have some oil/fat in it too, probably the aroma oil.

The noodles hydrate incredibly, they're almost like fresh!
The miso is strong, rich, and tangy, definitely make it a broth!

Noodles this good out of the microwave is excellent, it's just missing a wow factor like a topping packet.
