Packet explosion!
Lots of veg packets and not a single dry packet.
No powdered soup base today!
Fried bean curd packet comes with peanuts and the bean curd tastes flavorful, not like stale/cheap oil.

Really too much noodles though.
Very long cook time advised on the noodles up to 20 minutes!
I pulled them at about 10 of boiling.

Nice level of upfront heat.
The cow pea feels a bit raw but instructions did say to cook it.
Noodles are a bit on the chewy side.

The egg ball things were WAY too fishy for me.
There were actual snails in this though - which is gangster.
Overall, texturally good but nothing amazing IMO.
