Fried chickpeas is a nice touch.
Powdered potato and some noods, hot oil and veg flakes.
It really does need all the water.
My potatoes were gluey.
Hot oil very cuminy smell.

Potatoes stick to noodles well, and noodles aren't real bottom tier stuff.
A little kick, taste very cuminy.
Chickpea crunch is great!
Very novel!
A real winter warmer.
