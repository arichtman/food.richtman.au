Very fat and thick noodles, though they cooked quickly.
Packet cook instructions to boil for 3 minutes were accurate.
Very chewy noodles, hard to bite so each one is a commitment!
Flavor base is pretty standard mala profile.
Flavor is a little chemically and forward on the tongue.
They mix the seasoning powder with dehydrated vegetables.
This makes it tricky to rehydrate them without making a broth.
Peanuts are ok, a little waterlogged, the tofu skin is a nice touch.
As for heat, it's not spicy at all.
