Dried noodles, bit thicker than I like, says to boil from cold?
Couple substantial tofu sticks, boring vinegar, okay bamboo shoot,
peanuts, tablespoon of seasoned oil (not spicy), wet bean soup pack is nice, and the fried curd things are okay.
I'm not the biggest fan of these long beans either.

I fucked up the noodles somehow.
They were mushy outside before cooked inside.
I did start them in cold water, maybe too aggressive a boil.
Soup is okay, bit chemically, little spicy.
The tofu is a really nice bite but just a couple of them.
I skipped the fried skins, they smelled a bit of cheap oil.
It is actually quite spicy, but it's a creeping warm.

Flat 3.
It's par for luizhou style
