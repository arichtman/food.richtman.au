Only one packet that was all wet sauce.
Seemed to be mostly kecap manis or oyster sauce mixed with the usual stuff you get for mie goreng.

The noodles were small and green.

The water sort of emulsified with the sauce but it's too light of a flavor anyway.
There were little pieces of shallot in the sauce.
