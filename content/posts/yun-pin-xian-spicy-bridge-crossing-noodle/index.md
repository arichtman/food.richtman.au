Packs!
Sizeable dried veggie with tofu knot, nice pickled mustard green, soup base or brown sugar thing,
hot oil, some oil reserved mushroom, big pile of crunchy veg.
I dont like kelp, but this was okay!
Noodles are dried rice and split two packs, but the rest is all single packs so...

I like these rice noodles, nice and fine with chew not just snap.
Soup is good and savory, not too chemically, nice strength, not too spicy or mala.

Usual for rice Chinese Boodles loads of textures and bits.

I think being able to boil each noodle portion separately would be good for having this as a shared single on-the-table cook,
but it also suits me fine for not overdoing it on the noodles or eating it over some hours.
