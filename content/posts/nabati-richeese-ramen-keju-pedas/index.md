I cooked it dry so it was quite intense.
This can definitely support addition (packet says to add 200ml water).
I'm not sure I'd want 200ml of cheese soup though.
The spicy part is a chilli oil, which means it's not a stinging heat.
The oil base means you can stir it into an emulsion with the cooking water.
The oil was decently spicey and melted throughout the dish.
The noodles weren't anything special.
The cheese feels unhealthy but it's only a 67g packet.
This might make a good side dish or in a salad.
