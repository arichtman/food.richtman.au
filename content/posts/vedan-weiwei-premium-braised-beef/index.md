Meat packet! Two seasoning packets and one liquid, maybe vinegar.
The vegetable flakes include pickled mustard green as shown on the packet.
The meat packet has a good savory brown flavor, but still wasn't enough to season the dish.

The noodles are fine-thin, and not oily, decent quality.

The bean paste takes a bit of water to dissolve.
Flavor overall is light, not salty.

The liquid was cooking wine!
So don't wait to add this at the end like I did, it's not lovely raw.

Meat pack is good, flavor is nice, noodles not bad, but it all falls down on seasoning.
