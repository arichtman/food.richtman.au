Several wet packets included.
I don't like kelp, so I didn't add, but it tasted OK.
The pickled mustard and ginger was incredible.
Really savory and tasty, lifted the whole dish.
We also got dried vegetables, so 3 packets in all.
The noodles were quite fine, but also short.
Flavor was a nice hot oil profile, not strongly numbing or hot.
Flavor was strong enough for soup or veg, maybe a bit of both.
Still had a slight chemically tingle to it though.
