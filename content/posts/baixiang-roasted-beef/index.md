Basic ingredients, a powder and a small paste packet.
Pretty common noodles, thin.
The paste was scant and difficult to remove but with a strong anise flavor.

Very savory flavor and loads of salt.
Yummy but *needs* dilution.

Prepared dry it would bang in a cucumber salad.
I put cucumber strips into my bowl and let it pickle a little.
In future I might try making quick pickles with the seasoning packet and keep the paste to lubricate the noodles.

Tasty but not enough zhuzh to warrant a 4.
