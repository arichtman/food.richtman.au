Fat, flat bottoms and a nice ruffle on top, good shape for pan frying.
Some not sealed correctly.

Tastes like what you expect.
Not crazy hot but like, annoyingly hot?

The meat doesn't stick with the skin so hard to eat with dip but pre seasoned.
I kinda refer dumplings that need a sauce and have a more delicate texture and flavor.
I would take the bog-standard mass-made Chinese regulars over these easily.
