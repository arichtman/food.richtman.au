Three, clearly labelled packets for order; flakes, powder, and sauce.

The cooking time tips are nice.
You're supposed to add the flakes for cooking though, which I did not do due to making it dry.

The flavor is tomato-adjacent and enjoyable if mild.
The noodles resemble flat pasta quite well.
It required quite a bit of water to make the sauce, despite me trying to make it dry.

Very unique.
