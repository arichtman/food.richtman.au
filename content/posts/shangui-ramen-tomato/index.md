Substantially less generous with the packets than the spicy one.
Only came with soup paste and vegetables.
The veg pack has spring onion, egg, corn, and 2 little fish cake slices.
Definitely a worse deal.

The paste packet is red with a little oil.
The flavor is tomatoey and savoury, but quite light.
This can take a little soup or vegetables but not much.

Overall the two tiny fish cake slivers and corn don't make up the x-factor zshuzsh it needed.

King of tomato is better.
