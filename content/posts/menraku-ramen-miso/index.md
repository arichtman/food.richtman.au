I made this in the ready cup.
Powder with flakes, and a miso packet.

I let it steep a minute longer, 4 minutes.
Absolutely not cooked enough noodles at 4 minutes, I microwaved it for a while.

Flavor is fine, noodles are ok, not total trash but not good either.
The veg flakes are actually pieces of a nice little size including carrot.
