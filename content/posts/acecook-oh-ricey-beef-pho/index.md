Fake meat and spring onion flake, oil, soup powder.
Cooking can be by steeping.
Though I used the stove, this can be quite convenient.

Noodles are nice, flat and long with texture.
Flavor is not too complex but also not just white pepper, it is savory and comforting.
The rice starch from cooking thickened the soup a little.
The oil was fragrant, and the beef pieces were okay.

Overall I quite enjoy it, it's not quite novel enough to be a 4 and it's probably very middle of the road for Vietnamese instant.
