Cooking I went the microwave preparation option.
It is quite soupy.

The rice cakes are a little off, but mostly hit the spot.
My noodles were a little soft but worked ok.
The rice cakes turned tough again pretty quickly, so eat up.

The sauce was pungent but a little sweet for my taste.
The heat was middling, definitely not nothing but very managable.

If you're feeling like tangmyeon and topokki, this does it!
