Only one packet inside but it's a wet doozy.
Stinks like flavor and has aroma oils/fat in there.
The noodles seem unusual, waxy, almost.

The noodles are very well seasoned!
I didn't use the noodle cooking water for the soup as it would be too salty.
But even by itself the cooking water was tasty.

The noodles have excellent texture and chew for instant.
They don't break easily either.

The soup is deep and rich, with several flavor components, not flat.
This base easily makes a bowl of soup, and you should!
It's very dark for tonkotsu, but that may be the shoyu part.
It is very salty.

This would be a great base for quick ramen, just add some vegetables and a little topping.
