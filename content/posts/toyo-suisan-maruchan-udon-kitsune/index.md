Cup form.
Quite large block of fried tofu on top!
Couple powders, one soup base one chilli powder.
Some scrambled egg in there and I can hear veg flakes on bottom.

Noodles are wide and a little thick.
I left them to cook longer.
Broth is light and bonito like you expect from dashi.
Noodles slurp well.
Fried tofu is flavorful of its own but also takes the soup, very nice.
