Noodles are a bit thick and chalky.
The cook up kinda thicker and udony.

Two bags - powder and wet miso.
The miso smelt suspect but tasted ok, spicy and oily.
It's somewhat spicy, less than buldalk but not mild.

There's some nuance or fragrance from the miso, but I can't tell what it is.
MAybe bonito.

Topped off with broth and an egg yolk it did alright.
