Lots of packets and a weird smell.
The noodles have a long cook time, so plenty of time to unpack everything.

The pork skin packet is gelatinous.
The pickled bamboo shot is tangy with a bit of chilli.
The crispy bean curd is a delightful snack.

I couldn't find the English for the pork skin bag on the translated nutritional label.
I thought it was some mock product using bean curd.
Maybe it is?

For the packet size I expected two portions but it's just one.

The noodle texture is stretchy with a soft chew.
The pickled bamboo has a nice flavor and crunch.
The shape of the bamboo fits the noodle, so you can eat together.
The pork skin has a bit of a different taste and a soft texture, not as gummy and tough as real stuff.
The soup is decently strong, can handle some veggies or water.
The noodle surface is too smooth to grip the soup though.

I got a few very tiny pieces of what might have been meat or meat substitute.
They were savoury and a nice surprise.
I wonder if they were the snails I often see about ðŸ˜³

Not hot but it is spiced, I had a tiny nose drip by the end.
Accessible but warming.

No gritty five spice, no overly oily one-note hot oil, no harsh chemically taste.
Lots of contrasts both flavor and texture but a touch expensive at $AUD 6 per serve.
