Few packets, including some Textured Vegetable Protein (or maybe gluten).
The oil pack is nice, a touch spicy.
Noodles are big and flat.

Overall pretty nice, not hot at all.
The TVP was lovely, the noodles solid, and the oil amount adequate.

Definitely unique for being both vegan and without onion or garlic.
