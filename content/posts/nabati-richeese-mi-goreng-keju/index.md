Hoo yea that's powdered cheese smell.
The oil packet is an interesting choice atop powdered cheese.
Noodles are cheap and thin.

Low key the flavor kindof works.
It's red pepper with cheese, not too strong.
I still prefer more heat but it's a fine option.

Can't make it above average without something a bit more special though.
