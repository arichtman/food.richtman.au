Several packets, including intact vegetables.
Both powdered and wet tomato sauce, with some oil.
Surprisingly real tomato flavor!

The macaron cooked in 4 minutes in the pot, fast and to time.
I cooked the vegetables this time in with the macaroni to avoid rehydration issues.
The peas were still not hydrated despite this.
The macaroni was very smooth textured.

It's tangy and simple, really like a ketchup-based sauce.
It does the job.
The flavor is not strong, I doubt it could stretch to much soup.

It's different and interesting, but not stand-out in that category.
