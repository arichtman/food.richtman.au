Dried rice noodles, round, medium-small.
Hot oil, vinegar, dried herb, roast peanut, seasoning powder, sesame paste, seasoning oil, and kelp.

I don't care for kelp so not using it.
Dried herb is celery, which is unusual.
Hot oil a little spicy and rapeseedy.
Sesame paste is seasoned a little.
Seasoning oil packet is shallot I think, but very light taste.
Peanuts are salted and flavored and quite good! An easy snack while you cook the noodles...

Bag looks like it will be two portions but is just one.
I pulled the noodles after 6.5 minutes rather than the full 8

Very salty but beautiful and nutty and rich.
Decadent.

I really enjoyed these, almost to a 5
