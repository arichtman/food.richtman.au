Cup variety.
Wet/shelf stable noodles, vinegar, chilli oil, and flakes.
Flakes is barely flakes, mostly black and white sesame.
Appreciate the variety but almost no veg.
Vinegar is well seasoned.
Chili oil had more sesame, not too salty but maybe msg.

The faff cooking in the cup isn't worth it.
You also don't get the starchy water to help with emulsion.
Over here price was same for stove packet.
So next time that's it.

I gave up and microwaved it.
The noodles balloon and the starch holds a lot of heat.
They just wouldn't separate either.

The flavor though!
Gorgeously smokey!
Not salty enough though.
