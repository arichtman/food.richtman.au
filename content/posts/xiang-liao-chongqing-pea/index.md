Packets but not huge, wheat noodle.
The noodle pack makes some claims about 8h and 33%, looks branded.
Mustard greens pack looks branded also.
Chickpeas are nice - good mixture of texture.
No soup base, hot oil is quite salty and a bit of upfront heat.
Fried "meat" sauce is good.

Definitely on the saltier side, and not as a winning amount of veg as some others I loved.
Not sure it has the flavor to carry a soup but definitely the salinity for some extra veg.
