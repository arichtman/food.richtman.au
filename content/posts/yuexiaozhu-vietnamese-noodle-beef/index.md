Super aromatic and tangy, not really pho but nice

Noodles are difficult, they seem to have a very small window for perfect
Also it calls for a second pot to prepare the soup, which I didnt do cause its a pain

Very limey.
The locomotive one seems to just be more bare than the yellow lantern, unfair.
Beef balls are five spiced, so thats where that flavor has gone.
