Noodles are very thick and white.
Vegetable flakes, soup powder, and some paste.
The paste is a little oily and the powder is yellow.

The seasoning is quite strong and thickens up really well.
You definitely need water for this, though it's not too salty.
It's quite rich and the carrots and green are nice colors.

I cooked the noodles stovetop for one minute longer as they were still quiet opaque at four minutes.
In hindsight, they probably didn't need the extra time.

Overall a nice change of pace on noodles, thick soup, not overly salty, and an unusual flavor (curry).
