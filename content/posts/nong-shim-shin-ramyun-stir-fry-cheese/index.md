The noodles were much thinner than usual.
They are apparently quick-cooking, I found so.
There's nothing on the packet instructions about actually stir-frying or frying these.
It just says boil 2 minutes, drain and mix.
Funny cause others like yakisoba will actually ask you to fry it after boiling.

No veggies at all, just hot sauce and cheese powder.
There's a lot more cheese powder that hot sauce.
This can't bode well.

It did cook quicker than normal noodles.
The sauce, water, and cheese powder did come together in an emulsion.
For some reason it feels like a smaller portion overall than the weight would normally feel like (e.g. buldalk).
It'ss almost not spicy, just cheesy, with parsley (?) flakes.
It's not even salty enough to carry some vegetables or make sauce.
