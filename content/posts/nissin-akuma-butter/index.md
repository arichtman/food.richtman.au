Veg flake and wet sauce, though the Whole corn kernels are nice.
Very fried looking noodles, instructions say just steep and add egg.
I have no egg.

The noodles are really fucking tasty, heavily seasoned.
The wet pack is just finishing oil so I have to steep the noodles, then add.
I only added about 300 grams water.

Noodles are pretty shit, were way better raw.
The broth is crazy, very strong almost artificially buttery aroma.
There's almost no spice it's just overly buttery in a cloying way.
