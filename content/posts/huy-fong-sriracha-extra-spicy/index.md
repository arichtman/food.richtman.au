Decent kick of heat that actually builds quite high.
It's a tangy heat like the sauce, but not as fermented/funky.
There's some herbs added so it's a little complex.
It's comforting like a tomato soup.
I think some mozarella would have gone well with this.

Cooking:

The 4 minute steep that was recommended wasn't sufficient for my taste.
I microwaved it an additional minute or so.
The noodles are very standard, however they held up
to the extra cooking better than some of the cheaper brands.
When prepared dry the flavor packet is quite a lot,
you may wish to reserve some of the powder.
Overall the flavor is strong enough to carry some vegetables but not a large amount.
