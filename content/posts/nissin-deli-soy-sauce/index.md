A let down compared to the miso variety.
Salty enough to put something with it or make broth but next to no nuance or excitement.
Really tasted just like soy sauce on noodles.

Re cooking, this brand/line tends to boil up quite high.
I've found 300ml to be too much water.
I recommend really try to shoot for 250g to avoid messing up the microwave.
Also pop the lid otherwise it just spurts starchy water all over the walls.
