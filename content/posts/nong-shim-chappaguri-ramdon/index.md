Powder, misc soy chunks and little cute fish cake, and oil.
The powder is very dark.
Decent amount of oil but taste is light, mostly canola ey.
Oil packet had an easy tear option that worked great!
Super helpful for eating at a convenience store.

Instructions say to stir fry.
I did not.

Noodles are very hearty and took extra long to cook.
Seaweed is quite strong on the nose and palate.
Light but noticeable seafood taste.
Little savour and a tiny tickle of heat.
Good chew on the noodles.
Sauce emulsified and thickened nicely.

Definitely not my kind of flavor though.
