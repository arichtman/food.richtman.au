Nest of healthy-looking noodes.
Flavor powder, chilli powder, and a mixed oil and kecap manis sachet.
Quite a bit of oil.

The noodles indeed feel whole wheat or something.
I boiled them a bit longer as I prefer them more cooked.

Lots of seasoning, very peppery and salty.
Can definitely take some vegetables if prepared dry.

VERY white pepper forward.
