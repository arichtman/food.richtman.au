Beautiful peppery aroma with complex flavory.
Intensely savory and strong enough for soup or vegetables.
Meat pouch! It's tender but a little dry.
Veggie pouch! It's all carrot though.
Thicker noodles than usual but not the star of the show.
Chilli flakes included but no heat, just smooth peppery flavour.
