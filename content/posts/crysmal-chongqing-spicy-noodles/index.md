The noodles come wet, so only need a quick blanch or fry.
Unlike some other wet noodles, these ones don't have the bad oil smell.
I boiled mine 30 seconds like the instructions.
No peanuts, peas, chickpeas, tofu, or any large vegetables.
Black sesame seeds were a nice touch.
Medium heat, not upfront but it builds.
Not made for broth so struggled to provide enough flavor for vegetables.
Had an odd sourness, not like the usual vinegar/black vinegar.
Might be nice cold or in a salad.
