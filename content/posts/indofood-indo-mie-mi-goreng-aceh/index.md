Came with the usual mie goreng packets, except the oil was a rich, deep red.
The noodles also seemed thicker than the standard packs.

The red oil smells and tasts strongly of paprika, or some mild chilli, maybe lomboks.

It has a very nice savory flavour, it's sweet from the pepper with a satisfying little kick of heat at the end.
It's strong enough to take a modest amount of vegetables or soup.

For a very standard noodle pack the flavor is great!
I just can't justify a 5 for something that's so pedestrian otherwise.
