Package is an eye catching silver with stlyish design.
Was only $4 for four though...

Powdered sauce ick, seems like mostly sugar and some gochugaru.
"Wet" topokki, hydrated but shelf stable.
This is standard though.

I microwaved mine cause fuck dirtying a pan for this.

Topokki texture is good but the sauce is way too thin and brothy.
Seems like no thickener so maybe they rely on pan evaporation to thicken it.
Absolutely no heat, just sweet and red peppery.

With further microwaving it reduced a bit.
I think this would work well in pan, less water, and with something else, maybe an egg.
A melted slice of cheese went in okay for me.
