Fine noodles with light color chilli oil and some powder.
The powder is a pretty fragrant and chunky toasted chili powder, smells good.
Oil is a little spicy but not very flavorful.
Quite a bit of oil for the serving size.
I bet if you bloomed the spices in the oil it would slap.

Fragrant and a little crispy, maybe too oily, I tried to emulsify by stirring but not much luck.
Deep roasted notes and a good warming kick.
Really surpringly not salty or sweet.

Interesting! Would probablynslap with emulsion or cold with cucumber
Curiouser and curiouser but in need of technique to make it whole.
