Rating: 3

Red oil and red powder, quite a lot of powder.
Noodles are a bit thicker than super bog standard ones and cite 4 minute cook time.

Strong smell of...something, presumably lobster.
Not unpleasant but distinct and new to me.
Spice has a little kick.
Noodles are better than average.

3/5, maybe 4 if you love lobster.
