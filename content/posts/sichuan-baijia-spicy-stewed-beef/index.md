An excellent base for meals.
The flavor packet is really strong.
Hot but not spicy hot.
Strong aniseed and sichuan pepper flavor.
Not a weak or chalky rendition of 5-spice like many others.

Cooking:

The noodles are actually quite delicate.
I tried cooking them 3 minutes in 300ml water and they were mush.
Following the directions and soaking them gave a much better result.
The seasoning packet can really stand up to dilution.
I highly recommend making these dry and adding vegetables and some meat.
