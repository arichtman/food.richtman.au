This is a special item.
It's no longer available retail, only on JetStar flights.
There's no barcode on it even!
I got mine cause I had a flight credit for food but didn't want anything.

The instructions say 290ml or the line, but the line was closer to 200g for me.
I ended up using about 230g boiling water.
I can see why the in-flight instructions would have you wait a lot longer - the water's nowhere near boiling on a plane.

Rice noodles and some big veggie bits, whole peas and corn kernels.
Mushrooms and capsicums were shattered and the carrot was almost dust.

Gluten free so no wheat thickener.
I was still expecting a corn or potato or maltodextrin based thickener.
The soup is quite thin.

The taste was actually quite good!
Very fresh vegetables and earthy.
The noodles were deliberately short for spoon eating.
