I had the cup version.
Which comes with a boiled egg??!!
The egg is a soy sauce braised variety.
These shelf stable eggs are always bad though, squaky overcooked and dry yolk.

Mixed bean thread and regular noodles
Vinegar, paste, and powder.
The paste is very thick and beany.
The vinegar is sweet black vinegar.
Powder has little tofu knots and kelp flakes.

During cooking the tofu unknotted nicely.
The mixed noodle texture is good and the soup is hearty and savory.
I shorted the water quite a bit.
Maybe next time I'd give the wheat noodles a head start.

The mixed noodles is genius way of adding interest to the textures.
The heat has a nice warming to it, no mala, very comforting  and savory.
This egg was seasoned nicely and snappy instead of rubbery, still not amazing but not bad.
I'm sure the yolk in the soup would have been good.
I even found a rehydrated goji berry in here!

It's a really crude melange of things stuck together but it does hit the spot and lots of variety.
