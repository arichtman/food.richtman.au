Two sauce packets and a little powdered cheese one.
One sauce pack reminds me of the usual tomato paste and the other is a very oily, and glossy - beef...sauce?
The cheese smells kinda like parm but that could well be yeast extracts.

Thick looking noodles.
I would be extremely surprised if these cooked enough in just the cup.
The cup came with a two stage lid for draining.

Yup, noodles really took a beating in the pot to get all the way done.
While it definitely feels more spaghetti-ey than usual noodles, there's not enough flavor or punch to it.
It has _some_ herb flavor though, and the cheese makes a nice finishing garnish.
It will hit the spot in a pinch.
