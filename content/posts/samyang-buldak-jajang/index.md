Veg flake packet with peas and fake meat which I tried to rehydrate with a little water in the bowl while the noodles cooked.
Sauce packet is very viscous and dark.
Noodles look a tiny bit thinner than standard.

Not very spicy and for all the menacing of the black sauce it's not very complex or savory.
It did mix up to a nice consistency though.
Kinda sweet.
