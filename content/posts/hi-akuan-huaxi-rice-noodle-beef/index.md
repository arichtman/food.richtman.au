Lotta packets but they promised the rice noodles cook from soaking.
2 x dried veg, peas and tofu and flakes that smell like seaweed.

Oil packet, wet sauce packet, and powdered roasted chilli flakes packet.
Oil is not clear and has sesame seeds - gives me hope.
Flavor paste has that chariots rustically savory bean flavor, and looks glossy like it's emulsified.

Wet pack noodles have that shelf-stable smell.
Hope that washes off...

For all the oil there won't be starchy water to help the emulsion, worried about that.

It's quite smooth!
Not harsh and not really spicy.
A nice time.
