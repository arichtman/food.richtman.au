This is a special item.
It's not available retail, only on JetStar flights.
There's no barcode or SKU on it even!
Actually, thinking about that they probably only order them by the crate/box.

The instructions say 180ml or the line, but I didn't see the line and had already put 160ml.
I ended up topping off the last 20ml at the 10 minute mark as it looked lumpy.
I can see why the in-flight instructions would have you wait a lot longer - the water's nowhere near boiling on a plane.

The aroma is kinda parmesagne-ey.
Texture-wise it's quite chunky, the rice grains are really intact.
Actually, _really- intact, kinda toothsome.
The taste is quite good, oddly comforting and earthy.
Nice herbs and chunks of mushroom.
It is really mostly just rice though.

The parm is really moreish.
