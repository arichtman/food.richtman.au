Par cooked noodles, black vinegar, tofu skin rolls, sesame seeds, veg flake, bean paste.

Very misleading packaging as it showed all sorts of veg.
Very salty, needs water veg etc, very savory and a little spicy, the bean paste and vinegar are good.

Noodles slippery and round, easy to overcook.
Not too big a portion.
I put egg yolk to temper the salt and enhance the broth, as well as bok choy.
