Generous dried packet with soy, carrot slice, fish cake, and powder.
Oil packet again tastes more like just canola but appreciate the easy tear.

Sauce didn't thicken as much as ramdon, similar seafood flavor, kinda gloopy.
Flavor is extremely mild despite the red powder packet.
Noodles are same, took ages to cook, good chew.
