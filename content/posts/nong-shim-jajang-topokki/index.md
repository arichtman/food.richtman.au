Love the mix of textures, though microwave cooking can be tricky to get right.
Be sure to crack the lid and I would say leave the sauce till the end and discard half the cooking water.

The flavor is wonderful, it's almost chocolatey cocoaey but not overly sweet.
The portion size is quite small though, especially in contrast to cup size.
