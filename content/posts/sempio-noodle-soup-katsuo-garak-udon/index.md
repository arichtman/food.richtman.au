Just soup powder with flakes and dried noodles.
Flakes include seaweed and batter bits.

It's dashi but way under seasoned for me.
I was hoping for a warming pipe of soup.
Noodles aren't thick enough for udon and are nothing special

It's not actively bad but there's nowhere near enough flavor.
Maybe made dry would have been okay.
