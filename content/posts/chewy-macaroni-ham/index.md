Same as the chicken one in most regards.
Except, the stock packet is actually beef powder.
Yes, beef.
Yes, I know, it says ham.
You have as much an idea as I do.

I don't know how much evaporation during cooking they planned for but definitely don't add all the cooking water.

Still, whack a slice of processed cheese on it and some chilli powder and it hits the spot.
Just don't tell mum.
