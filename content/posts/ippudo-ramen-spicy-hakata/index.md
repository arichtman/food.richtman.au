High price and a fancy box.

Wet soup packets, dried proper noodles not the fried stuff.
No flakes or anything extra.
Soup pack is opaque creamy with lots of oil.
The noodles smelled maybe stale?

Suggested cook time was long at ten minutes.
Noodles took closer to seven or eight minutes and were pretty standard.
I made them dry and the sauce pack emulsified BEAUTIFULLY even with almost no water.
They have a very pleasant tingle of heat and a comforting, savory flavor.

Fine noodles but riding the brand too hard and I don't know Ippudo from a bar of soap.
Stingy on packets, a little menma or something, even just more soup base would have helped.
