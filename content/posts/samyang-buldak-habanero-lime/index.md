Flake packet is vegetable pieces instead of the usual sesame and seaweed.
The sauce packet is much thicker than usual.
The noodles are thinner than usual but the cook time is longer?

The sauce is immediately fragrant when mixing with hot water and noodles.
It's tangy and quite spicy.
It's not the usual pungent, garlicky affair, but really nice.

Overall it's different enough and yummy enough to really stand on it's own, without relying on the Buldalk brand.
