Comes with crunchy chips again, yay!
A small snack while you wait.

Pickled mustard green is savory and bright.
Dried vegetables is all spring onion.
Actual pickled chillis/peppers in vinegar.
Sauce packet broad-beany with a nice kick.
It has a few convincing-looking chunks of fake meat too.

The soup is overall sour, not pucker-your-face-sour but sour.
Consider how much of the chilli pickling liquid to add.
I really like that it's not hot oil based.

Overall it's a textural win again.
The chillies are a really pleasant pop, the mustard green has a nice snap,
and the crackers are a light crunch.
