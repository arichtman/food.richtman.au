Yellow lantern sounds hot!
Lots and lots of packets! Looks fancy!
Beef balls! Bean shoots! Aromatics! Dipping sauce! Herbs! Dried lime!

Delicate fresh herbs, fragrant dried lime,
bean shoots that aren't vinegarry from preservation, authentic meat,
non fried noodles, heat and a unique ingredient.

Truly a masterclass in components.

I managed to overcook the noodles while rushing to get all the packets assembled, next time I would do them separately

This was really really impressive.
One catch though.
The dish tasted nothing like what I know of Vietnamese noodle soups.

For anyone that likes this flavor it'll be a 6/5.
Still, very worth a shot trying if you come across them.
