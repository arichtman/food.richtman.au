Lots of packets in this one.
I was surprised to find it single serve for the price and size.
It is a big portion for one person, maybe 2 small portions.

Unusual components for ramen, white vinegar, bean paste, chilli powder.
The vegetable and soy protein pack was scaled up too.
The chicken bullion was wet and sour.
The chilli powder was a bit citrusy.

The noodles smelled weird when dry.
5 - 7 minutes recommended cooking time seemed long.
I pulled mine at 4 minutes of active boil time.
They were fine but lacked the alkaline spring and chew of other noodles.

Flavor-wise it's very intense and savory.
Chicken, bean paste, a bit of spice.
Definitely add water and vegetables as it's very salty and strong.
The soup was almost velvety thanks to the emulsified bullion.

The taste could be a bit more unique but there is much to like here.
