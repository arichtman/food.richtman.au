Three flavor packets and a mountain of powdered seasoning inside.
Coconut powder, I guess.

Feels very like an Indonesian laksa.

The mixture of oil and dry packets actually produced a nuanced broth.
This is one of the few noodle packets I added the full amount of water to.

Bummer that the noodles are a) so pedestrian, and b) not cooked in the broth for flavor.
They're just a bit too separate and flat flavorwise in comparison.

This broth with better noodles and some zhuzh could have been a 5
