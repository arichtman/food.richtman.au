Potato noodles, paste pack, and veg pack.
Paste pack is like solid oil, just like hot pot but with more spices.
Veg is potato slices, kelp, ear mushroom, lotus root, bamboo.

Potato is a mix of crunchy and soft, bamboo and lotus snappy, kelp and noodles soft, noodles chewy

Nice little kick for chinese hot pot, plenty of flavor. Little chemically but decent heat.
Whole cumin seeds and prickly ash.
Broth really well seasoned with shreds of chilli, oil, whole cumin and Szechuan peppers.
Noodles extremely slippery but cut to manageable length.
I thought this ate really well.
Hot water kept it hot after cooking.
