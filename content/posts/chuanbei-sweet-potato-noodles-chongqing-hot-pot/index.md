The noodles are quite special.
They are very slippery and chewy.
They can stand a long time in the broth.
The seasoning and taste is very standard Chinese tast, Sichuan pepper and such.
It's a little spicy but not much.
There is definitely enough flavor and salt for broth or vegetables.
I did not like the peas though.
They were't quite crisp and they didn't soften up enough either.
So they were just this awkward, tough thing.
I prefer the tofu sheets or peanuts of the other brands.
