I observed package directions by steeping in ~500ml hot water for 6 minutes.
The noodles did have a really rough texture outside that held the sauce well.
The rest of the seasoning was really light though.
These were better than the sesame paste variety but not by much.
I would consider them for a cold side dish on a hot day or maybe with salad.
