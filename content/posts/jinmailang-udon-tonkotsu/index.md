Big, thick noodles, with intact dried vegetables.
The flavor is savory and salty, can definitely make some soup.

Tonkotsu udon is not a pairing I've seen before at Japanese places.
The manufacturer seems Chinese anyhow.

The noodles are a nice change of pace but otherwise there's nothing special here.
