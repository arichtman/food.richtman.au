Quite a few packets, real chicken?!

Noodles look better quality, short cook time.

The double pack of chicken is generous and it provides both vegetables, soup, and fats.
Though the pieces are quite small, it ends up being almost like tuna, the way it disappears into the dish.

The soy sauce had a salt crystal, it disolves anyway.

The dumpling chips are fun, even if they are more carbs and sog out quickly.
Maybe better as a snack while preparing.

The chilli sauce is designed nicely so you can add what you like.

Overall all the component packs were really nice.

Flavor is quite mild, even dry and with chilli sauce.

It's above average for sure and generous, but the flavor is lacking
