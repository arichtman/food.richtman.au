Lots of packets!
Enoki mushrooms, different vegetables.
Looks good though no meat substitution that the rear pictures suggest.

Chilli packet has spice levels, presumably for how much to put in, I added all.
The Enoki aren't sour or pickled, which is nice.
Lots of spring onion flakes and some bok choy even.
Sesame seeds too!
The bean paste is very savory and has a nice kick of chilli.

Noodles are par cooked, just reheat them but I think they actually needed cooking.
The package was unclear, maybe 3-4 minutes of boiling.
They were difficult to separate without breaking.

The noodles are fat and round potato noodles, except they're actually tapioca and corn starch?
Texture is nice but not amazing.
Slippery with a soft chew but doesn't hold sauce.

The spice level is good, actually zingy that suits the mala.
The mala is nice, though it's a little on the chemical side.
It left my mouth vibrating.
