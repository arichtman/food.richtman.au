Not a lot of hopes for Japan for high heat.

Seems like just powder and a little oil.
Oil looks like ra yu but is a bit hotter, not flavorful though.
Noodles are nothing special but not trash tier either, I cooked em longer as is my way.

I did manage emulsion.
Taste is just okay, and the heat is artificial.
