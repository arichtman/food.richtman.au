The usual Shin powder packet plus a "salsa" wet sauce pack.
The powder pack is cheesy instead of the usual soup base, with tiny herb flakes.
Instructions actually don't call for a fry at all, though a ludicrously short cooking time if I'm right about shin's standard noodles.
The wet pack is suspiciously buldalky

Not overly salty, and not overly fake cheesy, with a touch of heat.
