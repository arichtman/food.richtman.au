Big noodles with cassava starch.
Looks like they're more meant to soak than actually boil, as they're already pretty hydrated.

Packets pretty standard, oil, vinegar, vegetable flake.
Black vinegar is tasty, and the veg contains both black and white sesame seeds, which is nice.

Noodles are interesting but really don't hold the sauce.
The sauce itself is quite good, a little spicy, a little sweet, not numbing or chemically.

It's slightly above average but not enough to recommend picking it out.
