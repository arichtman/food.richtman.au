Not much to this one, just a sauce packet and dried vegetables.
The packet shows fish cakes, crab stick, prawns...
But it doesn't seem fishy at all.
It had only one little naruto cake in the dried packet.

Not sure if some of the green veg flecks were supposed to be wakame...

The miso base is nice and creamy at least, if weak.
