Soup powder and a little oil packet. Noodles look dusted with seasoning and everything cheap as hell. Oil is nice.

Not overly salty or flavorful or hot but it's fine.
Noodles are actually quite well seasoned due to processing.
White pepper predominant.
Very mild tickle in the mouth.
Not a bad bite but just too average to make a 4.
