Thinner than usual noodles and square brick.
Veg flake packet has soy meat.
Also oil pack and sauce pack.
Sauce is thick and syrupy, tastes of soy, sugar and black pepper.
Oil is toasted sesame.

Sauce didnt feel like it emulsified nicely but flavor is strong.
Sweet, little salty, little peppery.
Noodles are fine, chewy but thinner than normal samyang.
The soy beef was tough and had an odd taste but I didnt cook it with the noodles.
Too sweet for my taste but not cloyingly so.
