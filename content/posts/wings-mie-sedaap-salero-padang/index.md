Noodles were very standard.
Lots of packets including a wet green chilli paste.
The spicy oil wasn't very spicy but it did build a little.
The crunchy croutons were nice and savory but didn't taste like rendang.
It was a little tangy with some generic savory underneath.
Not very memorable, I was hoping the wet chilli pasted would carry more flavor.
Overall the flavor wasn't too strong, so it can't take much veggies or water.
