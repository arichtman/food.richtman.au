Quite a few packets, the dried veg are substantial, with large pieces dried and intact.

Yum! Peanuts adding texture, fat, aroma, and calories.
A tomato wet soup base! It's very tangy!

Oil packet *as well* as containing Chili Crisp.
The oil is fragrant and the crisp is lemony.

The flavor overall is big and sour, but not chemically like some.
It's also not too numbing or hot, really nice.
Definitely salty enough to make some soup.

The dried veg were difficult to hydrate in the bowl.
Next time I would add some water from the pot just for the vegetables and soak them.

The noodles were fine, slippery with chew.
I didn't overcook them this time.

It's closer to a 5 for me because tomato, and especially *good* tomato noodles are rare.
Similarly, sour/tangy soups.
This matches my tastes and offers a LOT of textural contrast,
between the soup, veg, noodles, peanuts, sesames seeds, and chili crisp.
