Pretty clearly "inspired" by Buldalk.

Heat sauce is spicy but nuanced.
I'm not a fan of the seaweed and sesame but I see what they do for depth of flavour and texture.
They pop on fried eggs visually and texturally, too.

Chubby noodles and a big serve, they take A LOT of cooking to get soft.
Seriously, expect double the cooking time.

The fully cooked noodles have a very pleasant chewy texture, but the sauce is not enough for them.
It's spicy but less than buldalk.

Instructions said to cook noodles then fry in sauce.
This makes a lot of sense of the hard to cook noodles and underwhelming sauce.
