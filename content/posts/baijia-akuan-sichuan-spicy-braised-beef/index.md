Certainly the poorer of the two of this line I've tried.

The flavor is more on the mala side, but it's just like plain hot oil.
The oil packet contains flakes of chilli and sichuan pepper.
The flakes are a bit gritty but not unbearable.

The seasoning packet is slightly acrid and chemically.
The seasoning is quite strong so you can add vegetables or water.

Noodles are the same, so-so.
