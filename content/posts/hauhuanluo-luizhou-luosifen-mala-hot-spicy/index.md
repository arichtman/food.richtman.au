Many packs!! Very colorful!!

Peanut crispy, pickled veggies and bamboo.
The fried wontonny squares were not so fresh.
Not much hot oil, it has a kick but it tastes like a fake heat?
Quite a lot in the soup bag, very savoury and flavorful.

Too chemically when dry, definitely needs dilution.
Noodles are thick and slippery, and numbing and heat is here but the heat feels just chemically, not warming.

3 I think, probably a 4 without the hot oil packet.
