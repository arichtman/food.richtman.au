## Cooking

Typically I use a 1000W+ microwave.
I use a [Decor brand 1.5 litre container](https://www.decor.com.au/product/microsafe-round-steaming-rack-1-5-l/)

I'll preheat the water to boiling, then add noodles.
I usually microwave for one minute longer than the stovetop directions.

If there's a vegetable pack I'll try and put it in at the start so it can hydrate.
However, if I'm overshooting on water I'll keep it out for later.

If I'm confident in my water amount I might add sauce packets with the noodles.
Some sauce packets require cooking to take the raw edge off.
When that's the case I'll be sure to try adding them.

Some sauce packets impede cooking, e.g. oil packets or sesame paste.
These I heat gently and add last.

Meat packets I don't have a consistent approach to.
I don't like to microwave it the full time.
But also cold meat, fat, and sauce is yuck.
I think I'll experiment putting it in half-way.
